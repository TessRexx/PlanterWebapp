## Planter Web App
Planter is a web app that allows users to create an account, select their desired fruit and vegetable plants from an extensive list which will then be converted into a personalized planner in a yearly format. If the user has created an account and is logged in, this planner will be saved to their account where they can view the planner at any time. Otherwise, without an account, the user will be able to create a planner and download or print it but it will not be saved in the Planter database.
